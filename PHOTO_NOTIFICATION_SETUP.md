## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Firebase Storage

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/project-bridge-cm/storage)
2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Use test mode rules (for development):
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       match /{allPaths=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
4. Click **"Next"** then **"Done"**

✅ **Storage is now enabled!**

---

### Step 2: Get VAPID Key for Web Notifications

1. Go to [Firebase Console → Project Settings → Cloud Messaging](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/project-bridge-cm/settings/cloudmessaging)
2. Scroll to **"Web Push certificates"**
3. Click **"Generate key pair"**
4. Copy the key (looks like: `BKxxx...xxxxx`)
5. Open `lib/services/notification_service.dart`
6. Replace `YOUR_VAPID_KEY_HERE` with your key:
   ```dart
   final token = kIsWeb
       ? await _messaging.getToken(
           vapidKey: 'BKxxx...xxxxx', // <-- Paste your key here
         )
       : await _messaging.getToken();
   ```

✅ **Web notifications are now configured!**

---

### Step 3: Deploy Cloud Functions (Notifications)

1. Open terminal in the `functions` directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   ```

3. Deploy notification functions:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   OR
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

**Note:** Requires Firebase Blaze plan (pay-as-you-go). Free tier includes:
- 2M function invocations/month
- 400K GB-seconds compute time/month
- Typical cost: $0-5/month for small apps

✅ **Auto-notifications are now live!**

## 🔔 How Notifications Work

### Automatic Notifications

Once Cloud Functions are deployed, notifications are sent automatically:

1. **Project Update Posted** →
   ```
   📸 New Project Update
   "Framing complete, ready for inspection"
   ```

2. **File Uploaded** →
   ```
   📁 New File Uploaded
   "progress_photo_2025.jpg"
   ```

3. **Invoice Created** →
   ```
   💵 New Invoice
   "Final Payment - $5,000.00"
   ```

4. **Message Received** →
   ```
   💬 John (Contractor)
   "I'll be there at 9 AM tomorrow"
   ```

### Notification Preferences

Users can toggle notifications in their account settings:
- ✅ Project Updates
- ✅ Messages
- ✅ Invoices
- ✅ Reminders

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test File Upload:
1. Run app in Chrome: `flutter run -d chrome`
2. Sign in as contractor (demo: Admin1234/1234, choose Contractor)
3. Go to "Photos" → Upload a file
4. Check Firebase Console → Storage to see the uploaded file
5. Check Firestore → `files` collection for metadata

### Test Notifications:
1. Enable Firebase Auth (see `FIREBASE_AUTH_SETUP.md`)
2. Deploy Cloud Functions (see Step 3 above)
3. Open app in two browsers:
   - Browser 1: Sign in as contractor
   - Browser 2: Sign in as customer
4. In Browser 1 (contractor): Post an update or upload a file
5. Browser 2 (customer) should receive a notification

## 🔒 Security Rules

### Storage Rules (Production):
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Project files
    match /projects/{projectId}/files/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // User uploads
    match /uploads/{userId}/{fileName} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Firestore Rules (Add to existing):
```javascript
match /files/{fileId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
    resource.data.uploadedBy == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Firebase Storage:
- **Free Tier:** 5 GB storage, 1 GB/day downloads
- **Typical Usage:** 100 photos (~500 MB) = FREE
- **Paid:** $0.026/GB/month storage, $0.12/GB downloads

### Firebase Cloud Messaging:
- **FREE:** Unlimited push notifications

### Cloud Functions:
- **Free Tier:** 2M invocations/month
- **Typical Usage:** 1000 notifications/day = ~30K/month = FREE
- **Paid:** $0.40 per million invocations after free tier

### Estimated Total: $0-2/month for small to medium usage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Storage Upload Fails
1. Check Firebase Storage is enabled
2. Verify security rules allow writes
3. Check file size (max 10 MB by default)
4. Ensure user is signed in

### Notifications Not Received
1. Check FCM token is saved in Firestore
2. Verify VAPID key is correct (web)
3. Ensure Cloud Functions are deployed
4. Check browser notification permissions
5. Check user hasn't disabled that notification type

### Cloud Functions Not Deploying
1. Ensure Firebase Blaze plan is active
2. Run `firebase login` to re-authenticate
3. Check `functions/package.json` dependencies
4. Try `firebase deploy --only functions:onProjectUpdate` (deploy one at a time)
